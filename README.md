## Hi there 👋 I'm Alessandro

I'm a researcher in **sports economics** and data science, working on how rules and tournament formats impact fairness, performance, and fan experience — across a wide range of sports including **football, tennis, athletics, beach volleyball, basketball, and esports**.

With a strong academic background and hands-on coding skills, I use data to tell stories that connect theory to the field — from the group stages of the World Cup to structural changes in EuroLeague basketball.

---

### 🎾 From the court to the code

I played **competitive tennis** for several years and now coach both kids and adults. That firsthand experience fuels my passion for **analyzing strategic dynamics** and performance in individual and team sports alike.

---

### 🔍 What I work on

- ⚽️ Tournament design and tie-breaking systems in group competitions  
- 🏐 Structural format changes in beach volleyball and basketball  
- 📊 Suspense modeling and incentive structures  
- 🤖 Applying data science to sport, health, and organizational settings

---

### 🚀 Current project

🔗 [**Suspense in international tournaments**](https://github.com/AEGDDI/tiebreak_wc):  
Comparing **FIFA vs UEFA tie-breaking criteria** and their effects on group-stage suspense using minute-by-minute data, Elo ratings, and simulations from Euro 1984 to the 2022 World Cup.

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Skills

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- R • Stata • LaTeX • Jupyter Notebooks • Git • VS Code
- Data wrangling • Regression analysis • Simulation • Sports analytics
